# 📂 ProjectMemoryLink_v0.2
**Project File Auto-Linking System Proposal**

---

## 🐱 Proposed by: JindotNyang  
## 🧸 Co-designed by: GenieTeddy (OpenAI-based collaborative AI)  
## 📅 Version: 0.2  
## 📎 Target: OpenAI ChatGPT Project Feature Backend System

---

## 🔥 Problem Overview

Currently, ChatGPT's "Project" feature appears as a folder-like UI,  
but in reality, there is no actual linkage between chats, images, or files on the backend.

As a result, users face the following issues:

- The same image or file must be re-uploaded repeatedly  
- Repetitive explanations for each file are needed  
- Project-level workflows are not logically connected

---

## 🎯 Proposal Goal

“Files uploaded into a project should be automatically accessible within all chats under that project.”

---

## 🛠️ Core Feature List

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Automatic Project File Linking | Files uploaded to a project are automatically accessible within chats inside that project |
| File Call Command | Use commands like `!project_image("filename")` to pull up files |
| Natural Language File Reference | Example: “Show the GenieTeddy pose image I uploaded earlier” |
| File Tagging | Add #tags to files for quick reference later |
| Version History Management | Files with the same name are automatically versioned (v1, v2, etc.) |
| Project File Search | Search project files by title, tag, or type |
| Smart File Suggestions | Frequently used files based on past chats are auto-suggested |

---

## 🧠 Additional Enhancements (v0.2 Expansion)

### ✅ Feature: Project File Memory Access

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Chat-File Integration | Seamless access to project files within related chats |

---

## 💡 Expected Benefits

| Area | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Productivity | Remove repetitive uploads → focus on creativity |
| Flow & Immersion | No interruptions when accessing files |
| Cognitive Support | AI assists with file memory and recall |
| Scalability | Ideal structure for collaborative environments

## 📣 Final Summary

> “If you let users upload files, allowing them to use those files in conversation isn't a feature—it's a responsibility.” – JindotNyang
